Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course 18.904 _Seminar in Topology_ as it was taught by Dr. Andrew Snowden in Spring 2011.

Seminar in Topology is an [undergraduate math seminar](http://mathcomm.org/courses/course-structure/). As with all such seminars, the majority of lectures for this class are given by the students as part of their coursework. Students also write a final expository paper. This particular seminar serves as an introduction to algebraic topology at an advanced undergraduate level.

Additional information and resources related to MIT's undergraduate math seminars and teaching mathematical communication are available on the [MathDL Mathematical Communication](http://mathcomm.org/) website.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   To develop mathematical communication skills, including writing and presenting
*   To become acquainted with algebraic topology

Student Information
-------------------

![On average, about 9 students take this course each year.]({{< resource_file 93070fdd-45f5-8fb8-8b5d-699e92d9b8a6 >}})

### Breakdown by Year

The students were a mix of sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

### Breakdown by Major

All students were math majors.

### Enrollment Cap

Enrollment in undergraduate math seminars is limited to 12 in order to give students ample opportunity to present. Preference is given to mathematics majors. Beyond that, priority is given to students who have not taken the course before and to students who are closer to degree completion.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

*   Attendance was expected at three class sessions each week, for 50 minutes per session.
*   Students presented six times each, for 25 minutes per presentation.

Out of Class
------------

*   Presentation preparation
*   Problem sets
*   Final paper

Course Team Roles
-----------------

### Lead Instructor (Dr. Andrew Snowden)

Creating the syllabus and other course materials, coordinating the course, helping students with presentation preparation, providing feedback, grading.

### Communication Instructor (Susan Ruff)

Working with the lead instructor to brainstorm about course structure and materials, give feedback at practice presentations, develop a rubric for the final paper, and give feedback on paper drafts.
